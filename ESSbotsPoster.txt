Early adolescent friendship plays an important role in childhood development, 
and offline social networks have a positive association with 
mood, self-esteem, and lack of loneliness [1,2]. 
Yet teenagers increasingly rely on online communication platforms 
to connect with their friends,
which lack many of the important benefits of in-person interaction,
such as robust emotional expression and affective social touch [3].
To address some of the shortcomings of group online communication, 
we explore the design of ESSbots, 
a new kind of physical social media 
that takes advantage of swarm robots' tangibility, multiplicity, and agency 
to promote meaningful, embodied, and emotional connection 
among remote teen friend groups.
We conducted two exploratory workshops 
to broadly assess our idea, 
and we are currently conducting a series of iterative participatory design workshops with teenagers 
to understand how teens conceptualize ESSbots, 
how they want to communicate and use them, 
and how we can make creating custom robot behaviours accessible and engaging to teens.
Each workshop follows the same iterative approach:
Themed workshop with:
Group discussion questions
Demos
Interactive design activities
Post-workshop analysis:
Minimal collaborative data coding
Prototype iteration:
Robot behaviour improvement
Robot control improvement
Exploratory Workshops
ESSbots best communicate emotions, social closeness
Combinable behaviours create layered meaning (actions, parameters, swarmness)
Workshop Series 1: Conceptualizing ESSbots Communication
Conceptual model generated from exploratory workshop consistent with workshop 1 results
Natural mapping between behaviour type (action) and parameters or control
Workshop Series 2: Customization and Control
Situational context influences both robot behaviours and desired control method
Access to both simple behaviour presets and highly customizable robot programming is desirable
Participants found ESSbots most compelling for situations where they would be unable to see their friends in person
(e.g., they live in a different country), 
and want to feel closer to them. 
ESSbots are also best suited for sharing simple messages, 
and thus may work best when integrated with other social tech modalities.
ESSbots show promise as a supplemental social technology 
to support affective, embodied communication. 
We will continue to iterate on our prototype based on participant feedback, 
and we plan to conduct two more workshops 
to explore the social dynamics of using ESSbots within a remote friend group 
and evaluate a final prototype for the ESSbots system.
